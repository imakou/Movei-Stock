## Movie Stock

An APP provides movies' information as a side-project based on React and Redux. The app incloudes features like search, members manage and sharing. In addition, nice user interfaces and smooth operation are always what I am working for. In this project, there are lots of parts can be enhanced. I'd like do more different artitectures in this app (see [TODOs](#todos) below).
